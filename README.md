# TSLA Hedging & Option Analysis App

This project helps investors simulate and visualize option-based hedging strategies â€” especially protective PUTs â€” for TSLA and other tickers. It is transitioning from a CLI tool into an interactive **Streamlit web app**.

## ðŸš€ Features (CLI & Streamlit MVP)

### âœ… Current (CLI)
- TSLA stock data and historical price chart
- PUT option chain fetcher (from Yahoo Finance)
- Filter by volume, strike proximity, bid-ask spread
- Simulate payoff of buying a PUT (Option 5)
- Simulate capital-preserving hedge (Option 6)
- Breakeven zone plot with color-coded volume
- All results logged and saved

### ðŸ§± Streamlit App In Progress
- Interactive dashboard to:
  - Input #shares, purchase price, hedge budget
  - Choose expiration and PUT contracts
  - Simulate P&L visually
  - Generate insights and breakeven maps
- Download session logs and contract summaries
- Support for **any ticker**, not just TSLA
- Extendable to **CALL options** and multi-leg strategies
